## Joystick Control

Two schools of thought for joystick control.  

 1. Single Joy Control
	- Left joystick controls forward/back and rotational movement 
	- **Pro's**
		- *Right Joystick controls can control another device, such as camera*
	- **Con's**
		- *No way to control platforms that can translate sideways*
 2. Dual Joy Control
	 - Left joystick controls all translational movement, right joystick controls all rotational movement 
	- **Pro's**
		- *Supports all types of drive systems, potentially even three-dimensional movement*
	- **Con's**
		- *Lose a dedicated controller*
